## Overview
This repository hosts our group's submission for Task Sheet 2 of Collective robotics and scalability. The submission includes all necessary code, data visualizations (plots).

## Tasks
- **Task2.1a**: Calculate the average number of neighbors per firefly for vicinity distances r âˆˆ {0.05,0.1,0.5,1.4}
- **Task2.1b**: Determine the minimum and maximum number of concurrently flashing fireflies during the very last cycle (last L = 50 time steps starting from t = 4950)

## File structure
- count_neighbors.py and simulate_fireflies.py are used for the task2.1a in the file Task2_1_a.py
- File Task2_1_b.py contains the code for that second task.

Still waiting for the plot result for the second task.
